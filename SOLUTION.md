# Solution

- Refactored old structure to clean architecture with {domain, data, and features}
- Moved shared models to a shared-models folder so they can be reused in BE.

## Next steps or considerations:
- Implement a more robust error handling mechanism.
- Unit tests for all components and services.
- Integration tests for the entire application.
- End-to-end (E2E) tests for the entire application.
- Make use of Nx to manage the project structure and dependencies and utilize clean architecture through tooling.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
